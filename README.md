Web-App-Betterizers
===================

Some scripts that can be injected into webpages to maximize productivity.


## Gmail.js
### Draft-Delete
When you hit Ctrl+Shift+3 (a derivative of
Gmail's existing Shift+3 to delete a message),
the current draft is deleted, even if you're
currently editing it.
Perfect for when you accidentally hit 'a' or 'r'.
