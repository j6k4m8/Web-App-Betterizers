Web-App-Betterizers
===================

Some scripts that can be injected into webpages to maximize productivity.


## Gmail.js
### Draft-Delete
When you hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd> (a derivative of
Gmail's existing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd> to delete a message),
the current draft is deleted, even if you're
currently editing it.
Perfect for when you accidentally hit <kbd>a</kbd> or <kbd>r</kbd>.
 

## MightyText.js
### Ctrl+Enter to Send
When you disable enter-to-send in
MightyText, there's no keyboard shortcut
to send. This adds <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> keybinding
to send a message.
